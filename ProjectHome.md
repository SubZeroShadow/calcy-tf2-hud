# Calcy's Centered TF2 HUD #

This HUD for Team Fortress 2 changes moves the most essential information (health, ammo, cloak, metal, etc) to the center of your screen, next to the crosshair.  It also shows the build, destroy, and disguise menus in a more minimalistic fashion.  Download link is on your right (too lazy at the moment to upload screens).

# Alt TF2 HUD #
This HUD combines Essobie's ammo/charge/health indicators with aspects of flm's HUD and Cryzbl's engineer building HUD, as well as my own build/destroy/disguise menus and a few cosmetic changes of my own.  It has been updated to include the new HUD elements from the WAR update, and is known to work on 1280x1024, although it should (ideally) work on any resolution.  In addition to showing the numerical health of people you are looking at, it also does shows the numerical health in the killcam shot when you get killed.

Many thanks to Essobie, flm, and Cryzbl.
